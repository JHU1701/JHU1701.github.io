							<p>During my first year of college, we were given a challenge of creating a an innovative contraption that functions using just a 5 volt battery and does not exceed a twenty dollar budget.
								With the idea that I pitched to my team, we were able to spend just under ten dollars on the materials and we were able to amaze the judges with our creativity. I came up with the idea
								of creating a ping pong launcher off of an old sketch that I had created to make a DIY tennis ball launcher. The main challenge that we faced on the project was finding a way to generate enough tension
								in the rubberbands and I suggested that we used a servo motor to wind up the rubberbands and use another servo motor to lock the arm in place. Once we had succefully overcome that challenge, we found a way
								to automate the launcher and make it fully functional without us needing to reset it. I enjoyed leading my team through the challenge and I felt that it provided me with a strong team bonding experience.
